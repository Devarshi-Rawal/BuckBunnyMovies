## Description
Hello coders!I would like to present an app which inspired me from a recent interview task I was assigned with. This app reads the text file containing a json data. When user clicks the "download" button, the particular video gets downloaded at "Downloads" folder in the device. After downloading, there is also a provision to play it. I have used exoplayer to play the video.

## Note
About 10% of the desired features are missing which will be available soon.

## Android components as well as third party libraries used in the app
1. MVVM architecture
2. Databinding
3. Room Database
4. Download Manager
5. Exoplayer
6. Kotlin Flowables
7. Coroutines
